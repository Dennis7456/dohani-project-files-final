            "content": "The Ministry of Health, in partnership with international health organizations, has launched an ambitious malaria prevention campaign across Kenya's coastal regions. The initiative, which specifically targets Mombasa, Kilifi, and Kwale counties, aims to reduce malaria incidence by 40% over the next two years.\n\n**Community Education Programs**\nHealth workers will conduct door-to-door visits to educate families about malaria prevention, symptoms recognition, and the importance of seeking early treatment. Special emphasis will be placed on protecting pregnant women and children under five years old.\n\n**Bed Net Distribution**\nOver 500,000 long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) will be distributed free of charge to households in high-risk areas. The nets have been treated with advanced insecticides that remain effective for up to three years.\n\n**Healthcare Facility Strengthening**\nLocal health facilities, including Dohani Medicare Hospital, are being equipped with rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to ensure quick and accurate malaria diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Environmental Management**\nCommunity-based programs will focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites through proper waste management and water storage practices.\n\nDr. Sarah Mwangi, County Director of Health for Mombasa, emphasized the importance of community participation: \"This campaign's success depends on every household taking responsibility for malaria prevention. Simple actions like using bed nets consistently and eliminating stagnant water can save lives.\"\n\nThe campaign is expected to benefit over 2 million residents across the coastal region and serves as a model for similar initiatives in other parts of Kenya.",

Early detection allows for better management and prevention of complications.\n\n**Lifestyle Modifications**\n- **Diet**: Emphasize whole grains, vegetables, lean proteins, and traditional Kenyan foods like sukuma wiki and ugali in moderation\n- **Exercise**: At least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, including walking, swimming, or traditional dances\n- **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy BMI reduces diabetes risk significantly\n\n**Medical Care**\nProper medical management includes regular monitoring of blood sugar levels, medication adherence, and routine check-ups for complications affecting eyes, kidneys, and feet.\n\n**Community Support Programs**\nSeveral healthcare facilities in Mombasa, including Dohani Medicare Hospital, now offer diabetes support groups where patients share experiences and learn from healthcare professionals.\n\n\"Diabetes is manageable with the right approach,\" says Dr. Ochieng. \"The key is early detection, lifestyle changes, and consistent medical care.
