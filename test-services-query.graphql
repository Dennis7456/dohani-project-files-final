# Test query to check if MedicalServices exist in Hygraph
# Run this in your Hygraph API Playground to debug

# If the above doesn't work, try this simpler version:
query SimpleMedicalServices {

  }
}

# Check if the model name is different:
query CheckServices {
  services {
    id
    name
  }
}

# Check available types in your schema:
query IntrospectTypes {
  __schema {
