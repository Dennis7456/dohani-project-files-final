# 🎯 DateTime Format Issue Fixed!

## ✅ **Root Cause Identified:**
The enhanced debugging revealed the exact issue:
```
"variable.preferredDateTime datetime incompatible with RFC3339 profile of ISO8601 format"
```

## 🔧 **Fix Applied:**
Updated the DateTime formatting to include the required `.000Z` suffix:

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```javascript
preferredDateTime: "2025-10-23T08:00:00"  // Missing .000Z
```

### **After (Correct RFC3339):**
```javascript
preferredDateTime: "2025-10-23T08:00:00.000Z"  // Proper RFC3339 format
```

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

### **Step 1: Book an Appointment**
1. Go to your website
2. Fill out the appointment form
3. Submit the form

### **Step 2: Expected Results**
You should now see:
```
✅ Appointment created in CMS: cmh0gk8il12yw0klg65zrpms4
✅ Appointment booking completed successfully!
```

Instead of the 400 error!

### **Step 3: Verify in Hygraph**
1. Go to Hygraph → Content → Appointments
2. Check for the new appointment
3. Should see real appointment data from your website

## 📊 **Enhanced Debugging Added:**
The debugging now also validates DateTime formats:
```
🔍 DateTime format validation:
   preferredDateTime format check: true
   dateOfBirth format check: true
```

## 🎉 **Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ **No more 400 errors**
- ✅ **Appointments save directly to Hygraph CMS**
- ✅ **Success message shown to users**
- ✅ **Complete healthcare workflow functional**

**The DateTime format issue has been fixed! Test appointment booking now - it should work perfectly! 🏥✨**
