# ðŸ”§ Console Warnings Fixed!

## âœ… **All Warnings Resolved**

### 1. **React Router Future Flag Warnings** âœ…
**Problem**: React Router v6 showing warnings about upcoming v7 changes
**Solution**: Added future flags to BrowserRouter configuration

**Fixed in `src/main.jsx`:**
```jsx
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true
  }}
>
```

### 2. **Apollo DevTools Warning** âœ…
**Problem**: Apollo Client suggesting to install DevTools extension
**Solution**: Disabled DevTools connection to prevent the suggestion

**Fixed in `src/lib/graphql.js`:**
```javascript
// Disable dev tools to prevent console warnings
connectToDevTools: false
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result**

Your console should now be completely clean with:
- âœ… **No React Router warnings**
