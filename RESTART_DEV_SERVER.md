# ðŸ”„ Restart Dev Server to Pick Up New Token

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Identified**
Your token works in Hygraph Playground but not in our scripts. This usually means the dev server needs to restart to pick up the new environment variables.

## ðŸš€ **Quick Fix**

### **Step 1: Stop Dev Server**
In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
```bash
Ctrl+C  # Stop the server
```

### **Step 2: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Test Connection**
```bash
npm run check-schema
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Result**
After restarting, you should see:
```
âœ… Hygraph connection successful
âœ… Appointment schema exists
âœ… Appointment creation works!
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Why This Happens**
- Environment variables (`.env` file) are loaded when the server starts
- Changing `.env` requires server restart to pick up new values
- Your token works in Hygraph (proven by playground test)
- Scripts just need to use the updated token

## ðŸ§ª **Test Appointment Booking**
After the server restart:
1. **Go to your website**
2. **Book an appointment**
3. **Should now save to CMS** instead of showing error!

**This should fix the token issue! ðŸ”‘âœ¨**
