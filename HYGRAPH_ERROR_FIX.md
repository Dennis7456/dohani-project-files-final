# 🔧 Hygraph API Errors - Fixed!

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **400 Bad Request Errors**
**Problem**: GraphQL queries had missing variable declarations
- `$now` variable was used but not declared in query definitions
- This caused syntax errors in GraphQL

**Solution**: Added proper variable declarations:
```graphql
query GetHomepageData($now: DateTime!) {
  # ... query content
}
```

### 2. **429 Too Many Requests**
**Problem**: Rate limiting due to repeated failed requests
**Solution**: 
- Added `fetchPolicy: 'cache-first'` to reduce API calls
- Implemented fallback data system
- Added proper error handling to prevent retry loops

### 3. **Error Handling**
**Problem**: Errors were breaking the UI
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive fallback data
- Graceful error handling that doesn't expose errors to users
- Console warnings for debugging while maintaining functionality

## 🚀 What's Fixed
