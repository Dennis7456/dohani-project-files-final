2. Error handling still functions but without verbose logging
3. Admin components retain debugging capabilities
4. The application is ready for production deployment
5. Debug components can be re-enabled by uncommenting imports and usage

## Re-enabling Debug Mode
To re-enable debug logging for development:
1. Uncomment the console statements in the respective files
2. Uncomment ScrollPositionDebug imports and usage
3. Uncomment debug UI sections in App.jsx

## Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are set for production:
- `VITE_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT`
- `VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN`
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional, for ChatBot)
